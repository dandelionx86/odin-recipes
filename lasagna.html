        <h3>How to make the best lasagna ever.</h3>
        <p>This recipe was borrowed from The Pioneer Woman's <a href="https://www.thepioneerwoman.com/food-cooking/recipes/a11728/best-lasagna-recipe/">"Best Lasagna Recipe"</a></p>
        <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 lb. ground beef</li>
            <li>1 lb. hot breakfast sausage</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 cans (14.5 ounce) whole tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cans (6 ounce) tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. salt </li>
            <li>3 c. lowfat cottage cheese</li>
            <li>2 whole beaten eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 c. grated (not shredded) Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. dried parsley</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 package (10 ounce) lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 lb. sliced mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or saucepan, combine ground beef, sausage, and garlic. Cook over medium-high heat until browned. Drain half the fat; less if you’re feeling naughty. Add tomatoes, tomato paste, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil and 1 teaspoon salt. After adding the tomatoes, the sauce mixture should simmer for 45 minutes while you are working on the other steps.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix cottage cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan, 2 more tablespoons parsley, and 1 more teaspoon salt. Stir together well. Set aside. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and the olive oil to the boiling water, then cook the lasagna noodles until “al dente” (not overly cooked). Drain.</li>
            <li>To assemble: Arrange 4 cooked lasagna noodles in the bottom of a baking pan, overlapping if necessary. Spoon half the cottage cheese mixture over the noodles. Spread evenly. Cover cottage cheese with a layer of mozzarella cheese. Spoon a little less than half the meat/sauce mixture over the top. Repeat, ending with meat/sauce mixture. Sprinkle top generously with extra Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Either freeze, refrigerate for up to two days, or bake immediately: 350-degree oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until top is hot and bubbly.</li>
        </ol>
